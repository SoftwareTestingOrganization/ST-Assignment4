Introduction:

In a programming competition the students are required to design a program that takes three numbers (a, b, c) as inputs and determine whether the equation is Quadratic or not. The standard form of Quadratic Equation is ax2+bx+c=0, where a, b, c are constants and “a” cannot be zero. The program should have a method that calculates the nature of the roots of the Quadratic equation weather the roots of the equation are Real, Equal or Imaginary using the discriminant b2-4ac. 

Following are the conditions that should be meet:

• If b2-4ac>0 the roots are Real and Unequal.

• If b2-4ac=0 the roots are Real and Equal.

• If b2-4ac<0 the roots are Imaginary.
The program also depicts the shape of parabola i.e. (the shape of parabola is upwards or downwards depending on the value of a).
